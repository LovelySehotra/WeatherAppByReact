## Low-level Document Design (LLDD) - Weather App

### 1. Custom Hook: `useWeatherInfo`

#### State Variables
- `weatherData`: Stores the retrieved weather data.
- `loading`: Tracks whether the API request is in progress.
- `error`: Stores any error that occurs during the API request.

#### Functions

##### `getWeather(city: string): void`
- Parameters:
  - `city` (string): The name of the city for which weather data is to be fetched.
- Functionality:
  - Sets `loading` to `true` to indicate that the API request is in progress.
  - Clears any previous error by setting `error` to `null`.
  - Constructs the API URL using the provided `city`.
  - Sends a GET request to the API using `fetch`.
  - If successful, sets `weatherData` to the retrieved data and sets `loading` to `false`.
  - If an error occurs, sets `error` to the error object and sets `loading` to `false`.

##### `useEffect`
- Runs `getWeather` when the component mounts (with an empty dependency array) to fetch initial weather data.

### 2. WeatherApp Component

#### State Variables
- `city`: Stores the city name entered by the user.

#### Functions

##### `handleGetWeather(): void`
- Functionality:
  - Calls the `getWeather` function from the custom hook with the current `city` value to fetch weather data.
#### `formatTime(timestamp:number):timeString`
- Functionality:
  - Call the `formatTime` function for convert timestamp of `sunrise` and `sunset` into actual time.

#### Render Method
- Displays the following UI elements:
  - Input field for entering the city name.
  - "Get Weather" button to trigger data retrieval.
  - Loading indicator (conditionally displayed).
  - Error message (conditionally displayed).
  - Weather information (conditionally displayed).
  - Additional features (e.g., button to get weather information for the same city).

##### Styling
- Utilizes Tailwind CSS classes to style components and create a visually appealing interface.
- Divides weather information into visually appealing cards.

### 3. Dependencies

#### React
- The application is built using React, and component-based development is employed.

#### RapidAPI
- The third-party API RapidAPI is used for fetching weather data.

#### Tailwind CSS
- Tailwind CSS is utilized for styling the user interface components, providing a clean and responsive design.

### 4. Flow of Operations

#### User Interaction
1. User enters a city name in the input field.
2. User clicks the "Get Weather" button.

#### Data Retrieval
3. The `handleGetWeather` function is invoked.
4. The `getWeather` function from the custom hook is called with the entered city.
5. Loading indicator is displayed during the API request.

#### Error Handling
6. If an error occurs in the API request, an error message is displayed.

#### Successful Data Retrieval
7. If the API request is successful, weather information is displayed in a visually organized format.

### 5. Styling
- Tailwind CSS classes are used to style components, providing a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

### 6. Potential Enhancements
- Implement user settings to select temperature units (Celsius, Fahrenheit).
- Integrate geolocation to automatically detect the user's location.
- Implement local storage to store the user's last selected city for a personalized experience.

### 7. Conclusion
- The Weather App is a user-friendly application designed for efficient weather data retrieval and display. It incorporates detailed error handling and a visually pleasing interface using Tailwind CSS for styling. The app's flow ensures a smooth user experience when interacting with weather data.
